## Summary

I had a final project that I had to deal with Line Follower and what I had my robot do was only follow part of the line.

## Details

Using an image_cb and movement function, we can set up the robot to follow the line and then once the robot has reached a specific destination, the robot will stop following that line and then move on to the next task that it should be doing.
